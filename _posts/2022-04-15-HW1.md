title: How Does Geography Impact Climate?
---

In this post, I will be creating several interesting, interactive data graphics using the NOAA climate data that we’ve explored in the first several weeks of lectures.

## §1. Required Packages

To follow this tutorial, the following packages are required.


```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3
from plotly import express as px
import datetime
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```

## §2. Downloading Data

First, we need to load the three datasets into Python.


```python
# '../' is included in the path since the files used are one directory above
temps = pd.read_csv("../temps_stacked.csv")
temps.head()
```

## §3. Creating a Database

Next, we will create a database containing the datasets so that we can interact with them using SQL.


```python
conn = sqlite3.connect("../temps.db")

# Use if_exists to prevent errors when temps.db already exists.
temps.to_sql("temperatures", conn, if_exists="replace", index=False)
countries.to_sql("countries", conn, if_exists="replace", index=False)
stations.to_sql("stations", conn, if_exists="replace", index=False)

# Always remember to close a connection after use.
conn.close()
```

## §4. Average Temperature Change within a Country

The first question we want to answer is:
> How does the average yearly change in temperature vary within a given country?

To answer this, we first need to create a function that can query the database for relevant data. The necessary data is as follows:
- The station name.
- The latitude of the station.
- The longitude of the station.
- The name of the country in which the station is located.
- The year in which the reading was taken.
- The month in which the reading was taken.
- The average temperature at the specified station during the specified year and month. 


```python
def query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month):
    """
    Gets a country's temperature readings from its stations for a specified month across the provided timespan.

    Args:
        country (str): The name of a country (e.g. ‘South Korea’) for which data should be returned.
        year_begin (int): The earliest year for which data should be returned.
        year_end (int): The latest year for which data should be returned.
        month (int): The month of the year for which data should be returned.

    Returns:
        A Pandas dataframe of temperature readings for the specified country, in the specified date range, in the specified month of the year. 
    """
    
    conn = sqlite3.connect("../temps.db")

    cmd = \
    f"""
    SELECT S.name, latitude, longitude, C.name Country, year, month, temp
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN stations S on T.id=S.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C on SUBSTR(T.id,1,2)=fips_10_4
    WHERE Country='{country}' AND month={month} AND year BETWEEN {year_begin} AND {year_end}
    """

    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    conn.close()
    
    return df
```

As can be seen below, we can now use `query_climate_database()` to gather data for a specified country in a chosen timeframe.


```python
query_climate_database(country = "India", 
                       year_begin = 1980, 
                       year_end = 2020,
                       month = 1)
```

We are looking for the average yearly change for each station, which is essentially the slopes from fitting a linear regression model to each station's temperatures. The following helper function will make these slopes easy to find.


```python
def coef(data_group):
    """
    Calculates the average change in temperature over each year.

    Args:
        data_group (DataFrameGroupBy): Data that includes temperature recordings by year.
        
    Returns:
        Returns the average change in temperature.
    """
    X = data_group[["Year"]]
    y = data_group["Temp"]
    LR = LinearRegression()
    LR.fit(X, y)
    slope = LR.coef_[0]
    return slope
```

Next, we want to create an interactive geographic scatterplot, using Plotly Express, with a point for each station, such that the color of the point reflects an estimate of the yearly change in temperature during the specified month and time period at that station. 


```python
def temperature_coefficient_plot(country, year_begin, year_end, month, min_obs, **kwargs):
    """
    Plots a country's temperature readings from its stations for a specified month across the provided timespan.

    Args:
        country (str): The name of a country (e.g. ‘South Korea’) for which data should be returned.
        year_begin (int): The earliest year for which data should be returned.
        year_end (int): The latest year for which data should be returned.
        month (int): The month of the year for which data should be returned.
        min_obs (int): The minimum required number of years of data for any given station. 
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed to px.scatter_mapbox()
        
    Returns:
        Returns a plot with an estimate of the yearly change in temperature during the specified month and time period for stations in a country.
    """

    # Use the created query
    df = query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month)
    
    # Filter stations with minimum observations.
    df['count'] = df.groupby(["NAME"])["Year"].transform(len)
    df = df[df['count'] >= min_obs]
    
    # Calculate average increase in temp using coef() and round the values to 4 decimal places.
    coefs = df.groupby(["NAME"]).apply(coef)
    coefs = coefs.reset_index()
    df = df.merge(coefs.round(4))
    df.rename(columns={0:'Estimated Yearly<br>Increase \N{DEGREE SIGN}C'},inplace=True)

    # Get name of the month.
    M = datetime.datetime.strptime(str(month), "%m").strftime("%B")
    fig = px.scatter_mapbox(df, 
                            lat = "LATITUDE",
                            lon = "LONGITUDE", 
                            hover_name = "NAME", 
                            color = "Estimated Yearly<br>Increase \N{DEGREE SIGN}C", 
                            title= f"Estimates of yearly increase in temperature in {M} <br> for stations in {country}, years {year_begin} - {year_end}",
                            **kwargs)

    # Set the margins to make room for the title.
    fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":60,"l":0,"b":0})
    
    # Center the colorbar at 0
    fig.update_coloraxes(cmid=0)
    return fig
```

Now that we have created `temperature_coefficient_plot()`, we can use it to create a plot of estimated yearly increases in temperature during the month of January, in the interval 1980-2020, in India.


```python
color_map = px.colors.diverging.RdGy_r # choose a colormap

fig = temperature_coefficient_plot("India", 1980, 2020, 1, 
                                   min_obs = 10,
                                   zoom = 2,
                                   mapbox_style="carto-positron",
                                   color_continuous_scale=color_map)

fig.show()
```

{% include HW1\geo_scatter1.html %}

Let's also create a plot of estimated yearly increases in temperature during the month of May, in the interval 1980-2020, in the United Kingdom.


```python
fig = temperature_coefficient_plot("United Kingdom", 1980, 2020, 5, 
                                   min_obs = 10,
                                   zoom = 3,
                                   mapbox_style="carto-positron",
                                   color_continuous_scale=color_map)

fig.show()
```

{% include HW1/geo_scatter2.html %}


## §5. How do Elevation and Latitude Impact Temperature?

The next question we would like to answer is:
> How does station elevation and latitude relate to the average temperature within a given country?

To answer this, we first need to create a function that can query the database for relevant data. The necessary data is as follows:
- The station name.
- The latitude of the station.
- The elevation of the station.
- The name of the country in which the station is located.
- The year in which the reading was taken.
- The average temperature at the specified station during the specified year and month.


```python
def query_climate_database2(country, year, month):
    """
    Gets a country's temperature readings from its stations for a specified month across the provided timespan.

    Args:
        country (str): The name of a country (e.g. ‘South Korea’) for which data should be returned.
        year_begin (int): The earliest year for which data should be returned.
        year_end (int): The latest year for which data should be returned.
        month (int): The month of the year for which data should be returned.

    Returns:
        A Pandas dataframe of temperature readings for the specified country, in the specified date range, in the specified month of the year. 
    """
    
    conn = sqlite3.connect("../temps.db")

    cmd = \
    f"""
    SELECT S.name, latitude, stnelev, C.name Country, year, temp
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN stations S on T.id=S.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C on SUBSTR(T.id,1,2)=fips_10_4
    WHERE Country='{country}' AND year = {year} AND month = {month}
    """

    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    conn.close()
    
    return df
```

Next, we want to create an interactive scatterplot, using Plotly Express, with a point for each station, such that its position reflects the latitude and average temperature and the color of the point reflects the elevation. 


```python
def temperature_elevation_plot(country, year, month, **kwargs):
    """
    Plots a country's temperature readings from its stations for a specified year against the stations' elevation and latitude.

    Args:
        country (str): The name of a country (e.g. ‘South Korea’) for which data should be returned.
        year (int): The year for which data should be returned.
        month (int): They month for which data should be returned.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed to px.scatter()
        
    Returns:
        Returns a plot with the average temperature during the specified month and time period for stations in a country.
    """

    # Use the created query
    df = query_climate_database2(country, year, month)

    # Get name of the month.
    M = datetime.datetime.strptime(str(month), "%m").strftime("%B") # Get name of month.
    fig = px.scatter(df,
                     x = "LATITUDE",
                     y = "Temp",
                     color = "STNELEV",
                     hover_name = "NAME",
                     labels={"LATITUDE": "Latitude", # Make the variable names readable.
                             "Temp": "Average Temperature \N{DEGREE SIGN}C",
                             "STNELEV": "Station Elevation"}, 
                     title= f"Average temperature for stations in {country} in {M}, {year}",
                     **kwargs)

    fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":30,"l":0,"b":0})
    
    # Edit the colorbar title to fit better
    fig.update_coloraxes(colorbar_title_text="Elevation of<br>Station (m)")
    return fig
```

Let's create a plot of the average temperatures recorded at each station in the United States during Janurary, 2020, against the stations' elevations and latitudes.


```python
color_map = px.colors.sequential.matter # choose a colormap
fig = temperature_elevation_plot("United States", 2020, 1,
                                 color_continuous_scale=color_map,
                                 opacity = 0.7)

fig.show()
```

{% include HW1/scatter.html %}


From this scatterplot, it there appears to be a linear relationship between latitude and average temperature and elevation and average temperature.

## §6. How do Temperatures Differ in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres?

The last question we would like to answer is:
> How do the distibutions of average temperatures differ in the northern and southern hemispheres over a year?

To answer this, we first need to create a function that can query the database for relevant data. The necessary data is as follows:
- The name of the country in which the station is located.
- The latitude of the station.
- The year in which the reading was taken.
- The month in which the reading was taken.
- The average temperature for the country over all of its stations during the specified year and month.


```python
def query_climate_database3(year):
    """
    Gets a country's temperature readings from its stations for a specified month across the provided timespan.

    Args:
        country (str): The name of a country (e.g. ‘South Korea’) for which data should be returned.
        year_begin (int): The earliest year for which data should be returned.
        year_end (int): The latest year for which data should be returned.
        month (int): The month of the year for which data should be returned.

    Returns:
        A Pandas dataframe of temperature readings for the specified country, in the specified date range, in the specified month of the year. 
    """
    
    conn = sqlite3.connect("../temps.db")

    cmd = \
    f"""
    SELECT C.name Country, latitude, year, month, AVG(temp) mean_temp
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN stations S on T.id=S.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C on SUBSTR(T.id,1,2)=fips_10_4
    WHERE year = {year}
    GROUP BY Country, month
    """

    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    conn.close()
    
    return df
```

Next, we want to create an interactive histogram, using Plotly Express, that reflects all of the countries' temperature readings for each month in a given year.


```python
def temperature_distribution_plot(year, **kwargs):
    """
    Plots the world's monthly temperature distributions for the given year

    Args:
        year (int): The year for which data should be returned.
        month (int): They month for which data should be returned.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed to px.histogram()
        
    Returns:
        Returns a plot with temperature distributions for each month.
    """

    # Use the created query
    df = query_climate_database3(year)

    # Filter and label each country's hemisphere.
    df['hem'] = df['LATITUDE'] > 0
    df['hem'].replace({True: 'North', False: 'South'}, inplace=True)
    
    fig = px.histogram(df,
                 x='mean_temp',
                 color="hem",
                 facet_row="Month",
                 labels={"hem": "Hemisphere",
                        "mean_temp": "Average Temperature \N{DEGREE SIGN}C"},
                 height = 1500, # Increase the height of the figure to fit all 12 distributions
                 title= f"Average temperature distributions for countries in the<br>Northern and Southern hemispheres in {year}"
                )

    fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":60,"l":0,"b":0})
    return fig
```

Let's create distributions of the average temperatures recorded in the northern and southern hemispheres in 2020.


```python
fig = temperature_distribution_plot(2020)
fig.show()
```

{% include HW1/hist.html %}

From these distributions, it appears that a higher percentage of countries in the northern hemisphere experience a more drastic change in average temperature over the period of a year compared to countries in the southern hemisphere.
